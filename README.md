## Whatâ€™s Inside

This playbook contains a variety of prompt examples that demonstrate my ability to:

- Write **formal and tone-adapted transformations** (e.g., rewriting emails professionally)  
- Craft **concise summaries** and **structured outputs** for executive use  
- Use **role-based prompting** to create helpful assistant personas (e.g., HR assistant)  
- Apply **chain-of-thought reasoning** for complex decision-making support  
- Extract **key information** from customer communications for automation  
- Generate **creative storytelling** content with style and thematic constraints
