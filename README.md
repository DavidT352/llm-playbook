# . LLM Playbook by David T

Welcome to my LLM Playbook, a curated collection of prompt engineering examples showcasing my skills in designing, refining, and applying prompts for large language models like ChatGPT.

## About Me

I am an aspiring prompt engineer focused on creating clear, efficient, and context-aware prompts that solve real-world problems across business, customer support, decision-making, and creative content.

## What‚Äôs Inside

This playbook contains a variety of prompt examples that demonstrate my ability to:

- Write formal and tone-adapted transformations (e.g., rewriting emails professionally)  
- Craft concise summaries and structured outputs for executive use  
- Use role-based prompting to create helpful assistant personas (e.g., HR assistant)  
- Apply chain-of-thought reasoning for complex decision-making support  
- Extract key information from customer communications for automation  
- Generate creative storytelling content with style and thematic constraints  
- Design business-friendly product comparisons for e-commerce analytics  

## Portfolio Prompts

### 1. Explain Modern Technology to a Historical Figure

**Prompt:**

Imagine you have Claudius Ptolemy ‚Äî the famous 2nd-century AD astronomer from Egypt ‚Äî in front of you. How would you explain wireless connectivity, phones, and instant long-distance communication to him?

**Result:**

- Invisible waves travel through the air like light, carrying voices and images instantly.

- A small handheld device (a ‚Äúphone‚Äù) sends and receives these waves to connect people far apart.

- This allows two people to see and speak with each other across great distances in real time‚Äîwithout messengers or written letters.

### 2. Email Rewrite (Formal Business Tone)

**Prompt:**  
Re-write this informal message for a business setting:  
"hey i need the report done asap can you send it before lunch time"

**Result:**  
Subject: Request for Report Submission Before Lunch  
Dear [Recipient's Name],  
I hope you're doing well. Could you please send me the completed report by lunchtime today? It‚Äôs quite urgent.  
Thank you in advance.  
Best regards,  
[Your Name]

### 3. Executive Summary Rewrite

**Prompt:**  
Summarize this for a busy executive in one or two bullet points:

However, revenue remained relatively flat due to ongoing adjustments in the ad pricing model. The product team is optimistic that recent UI updates will improve conversion metrics in Q3."

**Result:**  
- üìà Mobile user engagement increased 27% vs Q1  
- üí∞ Revenue flat due to ad pricing changes; UI updates expected to boost Q3 conversions

But Fenn‚Äôs courage was stronger than fear. He remembered a tale about a hidden stepping-stone path. With cleverness and heart, he solved the river's riddles and leapt from stone to stone. When he found Poppy, scared but unharmed, she hugged him tightly. ‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd come.‚Äù Fenn smiled. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what friends do.‚Äù From that day on, Fenn became the forest‚Äôs quiet hero ‚Äî not the biggest or strongest, but the bravest, with a heart full of friendship.
