## About Me

I am an aspiring prompt engineer focused on creating clear, efficient, and context-aware prompts that solve real-world problems across business, customer support, decision-making, and creative content.

## What’s Inside

This playbook contains a variety of prompt examples that demonstrate my ability to:

- Write **formal and tone-adapted transformations** (e.g., rewriting emails professionally)
- Craft **concise summaries** and **structured outputs** for executive use
- Use **role-based prompting** to create helpful assistant personas (e.g., HR assistant)
- Apply **chain-of-thought reasoning** for complex decision-making support
- Extract **key information** from customer communications for automation
- Generate **creative storytelling** content with style and thematic constraints

## Portfolio Prompts

### 1. Email Rewrite (Formal Business Tone)

**Prompt:**

> Re-write this informal message for a business setting:  
> "hey i need the report done asap can you send it before lunch time"

**Result:**

> Subject: Request for Report Submission Before Lunch  
> Dear [Recipient's Name],  
> I hope you're doing well. Could you please send me the completed report by lunchtime today? It’s quite urgent.  
> Thank you in advance.  
> Best regards,  
> [Your Name]

### 2. Executive Summary Rewrite

**Prompt:**

> Summarize this for a busy executive in one or two bullet points:  
> "The quarterly results for Q2 have shown a significant uptick in user engagement across all platforms, especially mobile, which saw a 27% increase compared to Q1. However, revenue remained relatively flat due to ongoing adjustments in the ad pricing model. The product team is optimistic that recent UI updates will improve conversion metrics in Q3."

**Result:**

- 📈 Mobile user engagement increased 27% vs Q1  
- 💰 Revenue flat due to ad pricing changes; UI updates expected to boost Q3 conversions

### 3. HR Policy Explanation Prompt

**Prompt:**

> Explain this policy clearly and formally to a new employee:  
> "As an employee you're entitled to 15 vacation per year. The request is to be made two weeks in advance to our manager and has to be approved by the manager."

**Result:**

> As a full-time employee, you are entitled to 15 days of paid vacation per calendar year. Vacation requests must be submitted at least two weeks in advance and are subject to your manager's approval.

### 4. Decision-Making Assistant Prompt

**Prompt:**

> Help a user decide whether to rent or buy a home. Use step-by-step reasoning and compare pros and cons for both options in a clear, concise way.

**Result:**

> **Renting Pros:** Lower upfront costs, flexibility, no maintenance.  
> **Renting Cons:** No equity, rent may rise, less control over property.  
> **Buying Pros:** Build equity, stability, tax benefits.  
> **Buying Cons:** High upfront cost, less flexibility, responsibility for maintenance.  
>
> **Recommendation:** If you need flexibility or don’t have savings for a down payment, renting may be better. If you’re financially stable and plan to stay long-term, buying may be the better investment.

### 5. Customer Support Extraction Prompt

**Prompt:**

> Extract the following from an email: customer name, product, issue description, and urgency level (if mentioned). Display output as bullet points for use in automation.

**Result Format Example:**

- **Customer Name:** Jane Doe  
- **Product:** Smart Thermostat X2  
- **Issue Description:** Device not connecting to Wi-Fi after firmware update  
- **Urgency:** High

### 6. Creative Writing: Children’s Fairy Tale

**Prompt:**

> Write a short imaginative fairy tale (about 150 words) for children. Main character: brave little fox. Setting: enchanted forest. Theme: friendship and courage. Tone: warm and uplifting.

**Result:**

> In an enchanted forest filled with glowing mushrooms and whispering trees, lived a brave little fox named Fenn. One morning, he heard that his best friend, a squirrel named Poppy, was trapped across the River of Riddles. The current was wild, and no one dared cross it. But Fenn’s courage was stronger than fear. He remembered a tale about a hidden stepping-stone path. With cleverness and heart, he solved the river's riddles and leapt from stone to stone. When he found Poppy, scared but unharmed, she hugged him tightly. “I knew you’d come.” Fenn smiled. “That’s what friends do.”  
> From that day on, Fenn became the forest’s quiet hero — not the biggest or strongest, but the bravest, with a heart full of friendship.
